    "Description": "<p>The ownCloud Desktop Client was vulnerable against MITM attacks until version 2.0.0 in combination with self-signed certificates. To be exploitable e following conditions have to be met:</p><ul><li>The connection to the remote ownCloud server must be secured using a self-signed certificate which the user imported in the ownCloud client.</li><li>The client needs to be compiled with a Qt release greater than 5.3.x (such as 5.4.x)</li><li>If all conditions are met the client send a single HTTP request containing potential secret data such as the Basic Authentication Headers or the ssion ID.</li><p>The issue was caused by calling the incorrect QNetworkReply::ignoreSslErrors overload: Omitting the errors to be ignored as a parameter, Qt's twork stack will ignore all errors. The code is now calling the overloaded version which ignores only the error acknowledged by the user. </p><p>ownCloud highly advises affected users to update affected clients as soon as possible to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. Users with such setup and that have experienced such a behaviour are encouraged to change their ownCloud passwords.</p><p>This is a partial regression of oC-SA-2015-009 (CVE-2015-4456).</p>",
    "ActionTaken": "<p>To protect our users ownCloud has issued the 2.0.1 client which addresses this issue. Users of older ownCloud clients are encouraged to import their certificate into the local system trust store.</p>",
