   "Description": "<p>The external SMB storage of ownCloud was not properly neutralizing all special elements which allows an adversary to execute arbitrary SMB commands.</p><p>This was caused by improperly sanitizing the ; character which is interpreted as command separator by smbclient (the used software to connect to SMB shared by ownCloud)</p><p>Effectively this allows an attacker to gain access to any file on the system or overwrite it, finally leading to a PHP code execution in the case of ownCloud's config file.</p>",
   "ActionTaken": "<p>Files containing a <code>;</code> are no longer processed on external SMB storages. This is no regression as handling files containing said character was not reliably possible before as well.</p><p>ownCloud 8.1 will feature a completely rewritten SMB storage with cleaner code to reduce the attack surface even more.</p>",
