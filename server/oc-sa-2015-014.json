An authenticated adversary may thus be able to get a listing of directories (but not the containing files) existing on the filesystem. However, it is not possible to access any of these files.</p><p>For a more technical description please take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.syss.de/pentest-blog/news-detail/?tx_news_pi1%5Bnews%5D=140&tx_news_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=News&tx_news_pi1%5Baction%5D=detail&cHash=3d9e93c60f57ab1885ac335974427a7f\">advisory of the reporter</a>.</p>",
