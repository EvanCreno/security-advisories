   "Description":"<p>ownCloud 7 introduced the so-called \"Asset Pipeline\". It is disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting asset-pipeline.enabled to true in config.php</p><p>When the setting is enabled ownCloud concatenates all CSS and JS files into a single large blob file. Thus the amount of initial required requests to the ownCloud instance is lower and therefore the instance is loaded faster.</p><p>The generated files are stored on the local filesystem and use a filename that is generated by hashing the original CSS and JS absolute file paths using MD5.</p><p>Therefore, an attacker could perform a brute-force attack to gain the information under which path (e.g. <code>/var/www/owncloud/</code>) the ownCloud instance was installed.</p>",
   "ActionTaken": "<p>The filename is now generated by using relative file paths to the ownCloud installation. Therefore an attacker cannot brute-force the absolute paths anymore.</p>",
