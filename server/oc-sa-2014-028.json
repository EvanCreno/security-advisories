   "Description":"<p>Due to not sanitising all user provided input, the \"bookmarks\" application shipped with the below mentioned ownCloud versions is vulnerable to a stored Cross-site scripting attack.<br/>The \"bookmarks\" application is disabled by default.</p><p>Abusing this vulnerability requires the user to import a malicious crafted \"bookmark file\". However, an attacker can leverage <a href=\"/security/advisory/?id=oc-sa-2014-027\">oC-SA-2014-027</a> to achieve this.</p><p>Successful exploitation requires that the victim then clicks on the malicious crafted entry within the bookmarks application.</p><p>ownCloud advises browsers to disable inline JavaScript execution due to the used Content-Security-Policy; this vulnerability is therefore not exploitable if you use a browser that supports the current CSP standard.</p>",
   "ActionTaken": "<p>The issue was caused by not verifying the protocol when importing a bookmark from a \"bookmark file\". Therefore it was possible to import links such as <code>javascript:alert(1)</code> resulting in a stored XSS vulnerability.</p><p>The template system is now verifying whether a bookmark url starts with a supported protocol. If not <code>http://</code> will be appended to the URL to avoid exploitability of such issues.</p>",
