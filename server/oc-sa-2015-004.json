   "Description":"<p>A blacklist bypass vulnerability including UTF-8 encoding in file paths in the mentioned ownCloud versions, allows authenticated remote attackers to bypass the file blacklist and upload files such as the <code>.htaccess</code> files.</p><p>An attacker could leverage this bypass by uploading a <code>.htaccess</code> and execute arbitrary PHP code if the <code>/data/</code> directory is stored inside the webroot and a webserver that interprets <code>.htaccess</code> files is used (e.g. Apache)</p><p>ownCloud always recommends to move the <code>data</code> directory outside of the web root.</p>", 
   "ActionTaken": "<p>The blacklist bypass has been fixed and unit tests has been added to prevent future regressions.</p>",
