   "Description": "<p>The “Lost Password” implementation is vulnerable to a Remote Timing Attack. The token used to secure the password reset is fetched from the database and compared to the user-specified value using the equals operator. An attacker successfully rebuilding the token can then specify an arbitrary password in POST which will overwrite the old password.</p><p>Please note that actual exploitation would require an attacker to be on the same LAN as the ownCloud server.</p>",
