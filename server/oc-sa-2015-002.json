   "Description":"<p>Due to not sanitising all user provided input, the \"documents\" application shipped with the mentioned ownCloud versions is vulnerable to multiple stored cross-site scripting attacks.<br/>The \"documents\"¬ù application is enabled by default in the ownCloud Community Edition but not shipped with the ownCloud Enterprise Edition.</p><p>Successful exploitation requires that the adversary is able to modify a WebODF document and a victim opens the shared document.</p><p>ownCloud advises browsers to disable inline JavaScript execution due to the used Content-Security-Policy; this vulnerability is therefore not exploitable if you use a browser that supports the current CSP standard. You can check at <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=contentsecuritypolicy\">CanIUse.com</a> whether your browser supports our Content-Security-Policy.</p>",
   "ActionTaken": "<p>The issue was caused by not sanitising a Dojo component in WebODF. These not sanitised parts are now properly sanitised and fixed with WebODF v0.5.5, details can be found at the <a href=\"https://github.com/kogmbh/WebODF/blob/v0.5.5/ChangeLog.md#fixes-1\">WebODF changelog</a>.</p>",
