   "Description": "<p>Due to not sanitising all user provided input, the \"activity\" application shipped with the mentioned ownCloud versions is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting attacks. The \"activity\" application is enabled by default in the ownCloud Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.</p><p>Successful exploitation requires that the adversary is able to create files containing the <code>&quot;</code> character. This character is forbidden by default in any current ownCloud version except 8.1.0 RC1, thus an actual exploitation requires that the user has mounted an external storage within ownCloud where a user can create files with such characters. Alternatively an adversary may discover a way to circumvent the input validation. (ownCloud is not aware of a bypass of to the input validation) - Furthermore the attacker must be able to share a folder containing the files with malicious filename with the victim.</p><p>Since ownCloud employs a strict Content-Security-Policy that forbids inline script execution. Thus this bug is unlikely to be exploitable on recent browsers that support Content-Security-Policy. (Firefox &gt;= 23, Chrome &gt;= 25, Safari &gt;= 7)</p>",
