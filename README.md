security-advisories
===================

This repository is the authoritative source of the security advisories of the Nextcloud project. The advisories displayed
on the website are generated from this source.

The advisories are maintained by members of the Nextcloud security team and any change requires final approval by members
of the Nextcloud security teams.

Grammatical corrections are more than welcome. We try to formulate our newer advisories in an easy to understand language
because we believe everybody should be able to understand the specific problems.
