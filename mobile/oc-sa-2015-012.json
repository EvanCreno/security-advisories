   "Description": "<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/owncloud/ios-library\">ownCloud iOS Library</a> was vulnerable against a remotely exploitable certification problem until version 1.1.2. The vulnerable library version is used by the official ownCloud iOS client until version 3.4.4.</p><p>Specifically it has been discovered that the used networking library (<a href=\"https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/\">AFNetworking</a>) is per default not ensuring whether the host-specific data (i.e. the Common Name (\"CN\") of the certificate) is actually associated with the connected remote host.</p><p>This effectively allows MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks, allowing adversaries in such a position to intercept the traffic of the application using the ownCloud iOS Library.</p><p>ownCloud highly advises users to update affected clients as soon as possible to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. Third-party developers using the ownCloud iOS Library are encouraged to update the library and provide users with updated client versions.</p>",
